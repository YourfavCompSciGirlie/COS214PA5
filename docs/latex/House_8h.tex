\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Definition of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classHouse}{House}} class, which represents a composite structure of rooms. 

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classHouse}{House}} class inherits from the \mbox{\hyperlink{classDevice}{Device}} class and acts as a container for multiple \mbox{\hyperlink{classRoom}{Room}} objects. It enables operations on the entire house as well as individual rooms, facilitating both composite design and device management within a smart home environment.
