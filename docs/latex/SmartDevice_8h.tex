\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the \mbox{\hyperlink{classSmartDevice}{Smart\+Device}} class, which acts as the context in the State Pattern. 

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classSmartDevice}{Smart\+Device}} class manages the current state of a smart device (e.\+g., \mbox{\hyperlink{classSmartLight}{Smart\+Light}}, Smart\+Door\+Lock, \mbox{\hyperlink{classSmartThermostat}{Smart\+Thermostat}}) and delegates device actions to the active state. It allows state transitions and provides an interface for performing actions and retrieving the device\textquotesingle{}s status and type.
