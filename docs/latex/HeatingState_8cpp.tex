\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classHeatingState}{Heating\+State}} class methods. 

This file provides the implementation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classHeatingState}{Heating\+State}} class, specifically defining the behavior when a device is in the \char`\"{}heating\char`\"{} state and handling the transition to the \char`\"{}cooling\char`\"{} state when needed.
