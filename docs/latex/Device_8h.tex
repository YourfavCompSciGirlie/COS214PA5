\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the abstract \mbox{\hyperlink{classDevice}{Device}} class, which acts as the Component in the Composite Pattern and represents a device that responds to sensor notifications. 

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classDevice}{Device}} class provides an abstract interface for all devices in the composite structure, representing both individual devices (leaves) and collections of devices (composites). It includes methods for performing actions, retrieving status, and managing the composite hierarchy (adding/removing/getting child devices).
