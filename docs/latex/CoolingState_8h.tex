\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Concrete class representing the \char`\"{}\+Cooling\char`\"{} state of a smart device. 

This class inherits from \mbox{\hyperlink{classDeviceState}{Device\+State}} and provides the behavior of a device when it is in the \char`\"{}cooling\char`\"{} state. It defines how the device should respond to actions when it is in this state.
