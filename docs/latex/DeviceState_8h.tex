\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Abstract class representing the state of a smart device in the Smart Home Automation System. 

This class defines the interface for different states that a \mbox{\hyperlink{classSmartDevice}{Smart\+Device}} can be in. Each concrete state (such as \mbox{\hyperlink{classOnState}{On\+State}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classOffState}{Off\+State}}, etc.) will inherit from this class and implement its own behavior for the methods declared here. It uses the State design pattern.
